6.522 There is indeed the inexpressible. This shows itself; it is the
mystical.

6.53 The right method of philosophy would be this. To say nothing
except what can be said, i.e. the propositions of natural science,
i.e. something that has nothing to do with philosophy: and then
always, when someone else wished to say something metaphys-
ical, to demonstrate to him that he had given no meaning to
certain signs in his propositions. This method would be un-
satisfying to the other—he would not have the feeling that we
were teaching him philosophy—but it would be the only strictly
correct method.

6.54 My propositions are elucidatory in this way: he who understands
me finally recognizes them as senseless, when he has climbed out
through them, on them, over them. (He must so to speak throw
away the ladder, after he has climbed up on it.)
He must surmount these propositions; then he sees the world
rightly.

7 Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.
